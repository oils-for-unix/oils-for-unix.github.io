<p>This is a big list of alternative shells!  (As opposed to the common POSIX-ish shells like bash and zsh)</p>
<p>Some of them are more like languages, and some are more interactive.  Some are active and some are dormant.  They are written in many different languages.</p>
<p>This wiki page is EDITABLE.  If you know of another significant or interesting shell, please add a link.  <strong>If it's a DSL embedded in another language (like Python or Haskell), add it to <a href="Internal-DSLs-for-Shell.html">Internal DSLs for Shell</a>.</strong></p>
