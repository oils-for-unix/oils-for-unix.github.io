<h3>June 2022</h3>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/s5co2f/where_contributors_have_problems_with#c_ndbezz">Here is a good question from lobste.rs</a>, in response to point 1 <a href="Where-Contributors-Have-Problems.html">Where Contributors Have Problems</a> (developing on OS X doesn't work well).</p>
<p>See my reply there.  I could turn it into a blog post, which I think will be beneficial to both the Oil and Nix projects.</p>
<p>Note that this is a different question than <em>Can Nix Use Oil?</em>, which is also interesting and I hope will happen eventually :-)</p>
