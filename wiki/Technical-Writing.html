<p>TODO: Accept donations?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/07/blog-roadmap.html#accepting-donations-for-a-technical-writer">http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/07/blog-roadmap.html#accepting-donations-for-a-technical-writer</a></p>
<p>We need a &quot;fiscal sponsor&quot; for Github sponsors.  And that makes sense anyway.</p>
<h2>&quot;Job&quot; Description</h2>
<p>This is of course premature because we have no money :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential:
<ul>
<li>Strong writing skills.  Simplification is hard and requires deep understanding.</li>
<li>Able to write, debug, and explain code samples (mostly in shell, but other languages are a plus)</li>
<li>Able to create legible tables and diagrams (we don't have much prior art here, opinions on a toolchain are welcome)</li>
<li>Knowledge of programming languages and operating systems, and willing to learn way too much about Unix shell.</li>
<li>Comfortable with Markdown files in Git, as well as plain HTML</li>
<li>A decent eye for formatting and readability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nice to have:
<ul>
<li>Can edit Python code and make PRs against the repo.  e.g. for <code>doctools/</code></li>
<li>Explain/advocate for Oil with their online presence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits:
<ul>
<li>Learning a ton about Shell, Python, C, C++, and Unix.  Arguably these technologies are the foundation of modern computing!  These skills are usable everywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Would like to see: prior writing, blog posts, etc.</p>
