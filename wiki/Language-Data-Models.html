<p>Based on &quot;The Memory Models That Underlie Programming Languages&quot; and my comments there.</p>
<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13293290</p>
<h3>The Models Each Language Uses</h3>
<ul>
<li>C and C++: typed object graph, COBOL records, homogeneous arrays -- hm this is the fullest model.</li>
<li>Go: like C and C++ but with GC</li>
<li>Java: typed object graph + homogeneous arrays (people sort of viewed this as a &quot;wart&quot;, but it looks good in retrospect)</li>
<li>JavaScript: untyped object graph.  ES5 or ES6 added homogeneous arrays!</li>
<li>Python: untyped object graph only!  Pandas adds homogeneous arrays.  (Values have types, but the composites don't have types)</li>
<li>Lua: same as Python, but no Pandas</li>
<li>Perl: same as Python</li>
<li>shell: POSIX shell has no model -- just strings.  Bash has half an array type and an associative array type which are sort of like an untyped COBOL records system.  (He mentions the hierarchical file system as a model, which is shell's answer for more structured data, but that proves it doesn't belong in the taxonomy)</li>
<li>OCaml: typed object graph.  It might have arrays, but typed linked lists are more central (and same with SML)</li>
<li>Scientific Languages
<ul>
<li>R: untyped object graph + homogeneous arrays, tables of heterogeneous columns</li>
<li>Julia/Matlab: matrices (multidimensional homogeneous arrays) are the core.</li>
<li>Wolfram/Mathematica: symbols?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jai language: like C, but has array-of-structures and structure-of-arrays flexibility.  Logical vs. Physical data model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Formats</h3>
<ul>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>Protocol Buffers.  NOTE: Added both maps and unions (could be mapped to sum types)</li>
<li>ASDL</li>
</ul>
<h2>Systems that Persist Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>SQL: relational model persisted
<ul>
<li>concrete storage: could be row-oriented or column oriented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>File system</li>
<li>Redis: dicts, lists, sets, counters (I think)</li>
</ul>
