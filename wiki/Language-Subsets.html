<p>Using a subset of a language can aid in automatic translation.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>TeX is written in Pascal and then converted to C</li>
<li>RPython: subset of Python with different semantics</li>
<li>Go language bootstrapping: convert the parser to a subset of C and then auto-convert to Go.</li>
</ul>
<p>In oil: I wrote the osh parser in a limited subset of Python, thinking I might convert it to C++.  Now I'm thinking about compiling to OVM first, and then later porting to oil (which we don't yet have a parser for.)</p>
