<p>Blog planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadup: syntactic puns.  List a bunch of examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>shell the good parts.</li>
<li>Shell the bad parts (everyone agreed on this.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no more room to add features to shell: bash 4.4.  The Literal Anti-Pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why add tables to Oil?  Because the output of &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;ps&quot; are both tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why add ADTs to Oil?  Because we want to actually parse things rather than relying on regexes and macro processing.  Sometimes that approach is good enough, but sometimes it isn't.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: <a href="Oil-and-the-R-Language.html">Oil and the R Language</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why Awk?  Because once you add hash tables and regexes to shell, which bash/zsh have already done, then it's almost an Awk already.  The only difference is the implicit outer loop of awk (for each file, for each line, for each field).</li>
<li>Why Make?  Because 90% of the lines in a Makefile are either variable assignments or <strong>literal</strong> shell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interesting facts about other language implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clang AST, TypeScript external visitors with &quot;switch&quot;, TableGen language in LLVM, sh/awk/C code gen in most shells.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking abstractions -- the <code>git log | python</code> pipeline is like the Go-style of unicode handling with utf-8.  You don't always have to parse, operate, serialize.  Sometimes you can just massage the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote evaluation.  <code>ssh user@host find -type f -a -executable</code> sends an expression over the wire, just like SQL does.  Or <code>sh</code>, <code>awk</code>, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
