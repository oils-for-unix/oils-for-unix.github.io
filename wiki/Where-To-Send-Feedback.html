<p>We're looking for feedback on Oils!  This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compatible OSH language.
<ul>
<li>Does it run your shell and bash scripts?</li>
<li>How can we make debugging eaiser?</li>
<li>Are the error messages helpful?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new YSH language.
<ul>
<li>Do you like the syntax?</li>
<li>Does it work the way you expect?</li>
<li>What documentation do you need that is missing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The interactive shell (lower priority, but still welcome)</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.  You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open an issue <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues">on Github</a>.  You can also search for existing, related issues.</li>
<li>Start a new topic on <code>#oil-help</code> or <code>#oil-discuss</code> on <a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/">oilshell.zulipchat.com</a> (requires login with Github or Google).
<ul>
<li>The &quot;new topic&quot; button is usually at the bottom of the page.  For a quick overview of Zulip, see <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/986444234365521920">this picture</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/04/26.html">this blog post</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or chat with me directly.  However basically anything is on topic for <code>#oil-discuss</code>.  Don't be shy about asking!  Many things are not documented, and your questions will help me fill that gap.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Please Send Security Issues to andy at oilshell dot org</h2>
<p>That is, if disclosing the bug would lead to real systems being hacked, use e-mail rather than Github or Zulip.</p>
<h2>Feedback That's Useful</h2>
<h3>OSH or YSH has a bug -- here is the repro.</h3>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/1864#issue-2188861648">https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/1864#issue-2188861648</a> - crash in <code>ctx</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/1822#issuecomment-1969880870">https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues/1822#issuecomment-1969880870</a> - bug running starship</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why does OSH/YSH behave like this?</h3>
<p>This is valid and useful feedback -- questions are always welcome.</p>
<p>You may be pointed to a FAQ, but that's ok!</p>
<p>Please post as much <strong>real code</strong> as you can, along with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the output you <strong>expect</strong></li>
<li>what <strong>actually</strong> happened.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I want to do this in YSH, but I don't know how.</h3>
<p>Even if you don't know exactly what you want to do, asking on <code>#oil-help</code> is valid!  The language is still evolving, so we like to hear what problems people have using it.</p>
<p>Again, posting real code helps.</p>
<h3>I can't find docs on X.</h3>
<p>The docs are still in progress, so this is unfortunately somewhat expected.  Posting on <code>#oil-help</code> should give you a quick answer - either a link to existing docs, or an explanation that can be copied into docs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oils.pub/release/latest/doc/faq-doc.html"><strong>FAQ on Documentation</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>I used YSH successfully.</h3>
<p>This is great feedback, and worth posting even if you don't need a response!    I enjoy reading success stories.</p>
<h2>Less Useful Feedback</h2>
<h3>I want YSH to behave like this.</h3>
<p>It's often better to start by clearly stating the <strong>problem</strong>, and only then then the solution you have in mind.  There are always <strong>multiple</strong> solutions to any given problem.</p>
<p>Every person has a different background, so what's &quot;intuitive&quot; to one person may not be inuitive to another.</p>
<p>See <a href="Language-Design-Principles.html">Language Design Principles</a> for some core axioms -- e.g. <em>YSH is for Python and JavaScript users that avoid shell</em>.</p>
