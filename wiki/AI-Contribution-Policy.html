    [devtools] Script to convert Zulip-flavored Markdown to CommonMark
    
    This removes some labor when writing blog posts.
    
    Genreated with Claude Code!  See note at the top fo the file.

<p>Another example (gnuplot generated by Claude; will probably not use this): https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/commit/9a7092cf4fdb95399287e5261232176fac576604</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to make code <strong>easy to read for humans</strong>
<ul>
<li>That is one reason Oils is implemented &quot;middle out&quot;, in Python</li>
<li>e.g. Python is easier to read than C++, because you don't have to check for memory safety errors!  They are often invisible in the source</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI could be used to <strong>iterate quickly</strong> on code, <strong>finding the best way</strong> to make it easy to read for humans
<ul>
<li>Or it could be used to <strong>make a mess</strong> by generating a ton of code, in different languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example: R versus SQL / R versus gnuplot</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am still wrestling with choices on tools to use for data analysis / plotting</li>
<li>We will probably keep SQL, but gnuplot is another language I don't want to learn, and I don't want to force contributors to learn</li>
<li>Most contributors don't know R, but it is arguably worth learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to use technologies that <strong>repay learning</strong></p>
<p>I think SQL and R  fall in that category, but gnuplot probably doesn't.</p>
<h2>NLnet AI Contribution Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nlnet.nl/foundation/policies/generativeAI/">https://nlnet.nl/foundation/policies/generativeAI/</a> - This is similar to our policy, but also worth reading.  All our work should follow this policy.</li>
