<p>Exhaustive test suites (i.e. nearly 100% test coverage) make a lot of hard problems easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>type checking: like I'm doing with ASDL.  You can have a very strict type system, but have it be dynamically checked.  It's trivial to implement and helps program correctness a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>buffer overflow detection and security testing: ASAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance testing.  Microbenchmarks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better code structure due to fearless refactoring</p>
</li>
</ul>
