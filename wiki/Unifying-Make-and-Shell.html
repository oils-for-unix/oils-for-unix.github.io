<p>General problem: do they support build variants in multiple output dirs?  For example, I believe this is hard/impossible with the <code>redo</code> model, and I don't like tons of tiny shell scripts.</p>

And what I want from a build tool (build variants to support performance, security, correctness, etc.)</p>
