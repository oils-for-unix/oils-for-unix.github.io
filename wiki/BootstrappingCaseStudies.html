<h2>Bootstrapped Compilers (written in the same language it compiles)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust: first compiler written in OCaml; then bootstrapped in Rust
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/graydon/rust-prehistory">graydon/rust-prehistory</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go: first compiler written in C; then bootstrapped in Go
<ul>
<li>the Go C compilers in C weren't written written from scratch; they were derived from Ken Thompson's C compilers for Plan 9</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://github.com/rsc/c2go">c2go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rsc/grind">grind</a> tool to convert C to Go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D: C++; then bootstrapped in D (only recently)</li>
<li>CoffeeScript: Ruby; then bootstrapped CoffeeScript</li>
<li>Nim: Free Pascal; then bootstrapped Nim</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bootstrapped But Not Sure About the Original</h2>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript: currently written in TypeScript; not sure what it started with</li>
<li>Haskell: currently written in Haskell</li>
<li>OCaml: currently written in OCaml
<ul>
<li>Maybe LeLisp, according to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kkrmm9/bootstrapping_case_studies/">Reddit Comments</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not Bootstrapped</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elm: Written in Haskell</li>
<li>Haxe: Written in OCaml</li>
<li>Swift: I think it's mostly written in C++ (?)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self Hosted Subsets</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rswier/c4">C4: C in Four Functions</a> compiles itself</li>
<li>tinypy's bytecode compiler: The compiler is written in the subset of Python that tinypy accepts, so it was bootstrapped with CPython, but now it runs itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raku (formerly Perl 6): Uses the subset NQP (Not Quite Perl)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bootstrapping.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://bootstrapping.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> - Wiki about building up compilers from nothing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributions Welcome</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feel free to add any other case studies, e.g. Crystal, etc.
<ul>
<li>What about C?  Was the first compiler in B, BCPL, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or add links to justify the existing entries (mostly done off the top of my head, after looking at repos for a few years)</li>
</ul>
