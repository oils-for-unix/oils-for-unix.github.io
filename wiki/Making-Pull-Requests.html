<p>These guidelines will help me review PRs more quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please use Github's UI to <strong>request review</strong>, so I know when I should look at a PR.
<ul>
<li>Add <code>andychu</code> as reviewer in the upper right.</li>
<li>(This is a new thing as of 2025-11)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please write a good <strong>commit description</strong>:
<ul>
<li>What changed?  This can be written for a <strong>user</strong> to read.  (TODO: we should come up with an automated release notes system)</li>
<li>How did you <strong>test</strong> it?  Often this is via spec tests, but not always.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do docs need to be updated?
<ul>
<li>Feel free to ask for help / tips on this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will use Github's system to make comments.  After addressing them, please:
<ul>
<li>Push the commits so I can see them</li>
<li>Reply with a message, like &quot;All done&quot;, or &quot;I disagree because ...&quot;</li>
<li>Click on the upper right to <strong>re-request review</strong>, so it appears in my list of things to review</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you only push commits, I won't look at the PR again, because I'll assume it's in progress.</p>
<p>Also, please feel free to <strong>ask questions</strong> even if the PR isn't ready for review yet!  There are often many different files to modify.</p>
<p>I aim for a <strong>initial response in 24 hours</strong>, so feel free to ping me after that.  (As of 2025-11, the delay has been a bit longer on occasion.  But still feel free to ping me.)</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instructions on using the CI</li>
<li>Types of tests and our standards for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Send PRs from <code>oils-for-unix/oils</code> and not your own fork, so that Github Actions can get our $TOIL_KEY, and publish HTML results to https://op.oilshell.org/</p>
<h2>Link</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is what I use to find pull requests to review: <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+user-review-requested%3A%40me">https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+user-review-requested%3A%40me</a></li>
