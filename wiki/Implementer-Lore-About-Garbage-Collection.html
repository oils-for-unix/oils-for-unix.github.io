<p>&quot;Implementer lore&quot; means &quot;programming techniques that are only in a few experienced people's heads!&quot;</p>
<p>It's not in textbooks.  I've found that there is a lot of it with respect to implementing garbage collectors.  The algorithms are one thing, but there are many nontrivial problems in the implementation.  It interacts with the host language a lot, which is usually C, C++, or Assembly.</p>
